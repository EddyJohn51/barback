Barback
======

What is Barback?
------
Barback is a React Native application that fetches cocktail recipes from The Cocktail DB API. It supports text search to find recipes in full.
I had originally planned to implement a barcode scanner to find recipes (using UPCItemDB's API), however I cannot find a great way to get the _type_** of spirit
from the UPC code since the Cocktail DB doesn't search by brand name. In the future, I hope to figure out a way to make the barcode scanner work. For now, if you scan the
barcode of a project, it will just display information available from the UPC API.
